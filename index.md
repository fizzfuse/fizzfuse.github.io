----PsyPhi Records Presents: PSYHOP_002----

The Psyhop is a fresh project by the FizzFuze crew, bringing psychedelic techno and psytrance artists from around the world to Philadelphia & beyond. PsyPhi Records is a fresh label brewing in the background, with hometown releases scheduled for early 2025. Keep an ear out for unreleased tracks at our upcoming events. :)

October 11th, 2024 we will be hosting AlpaKa MuziK from Montreal. They are international heavy hitters in the psytech scene.

KOZY aka Jeff Koz is a Montreal-based DJ & Entrepreneur specialising in dark & groovy underground techno music. KOZY's dedication to music is evident in his tight mixes, solid track selection and inclination towards groovy synths and heavy, disruptive bass. In 2019, he founded AlpaKa MuziK, a Montreal-based record label pushing world-class underground progressive, minimal and psychedelic techno beats.

Quantaloop, the brainchild of Etienne Sarrazin and Pasquale De Luca, have
established themselves as trailblazers in the psychedelic community with their
unique brand of twisted techno music. Drawing from their deep knowledge pool
of electronic music knowledge their style aims to blend the best elements from
many different genres while staying true to their psychedelic roots. Their sound is
known for being unique and instantly recognizable in any set due to its
technicality married with a constantly evolving but very much dance floor groove.
